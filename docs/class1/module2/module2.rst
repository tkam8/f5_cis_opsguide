CIS and ScaleN (N+1) - w/ Auto Config-Sync
===========================

**Description**: 
The ScaleN architecture allows you to create a redundant system configuration for multiple BIG-IP devices on a network.This guide will focus on the tips and best practices for building this in a lab for testing. For a full guide to the installation, please refer to the official documentation on |askf5|_ or |clouddocs|_. 

**Prerequisites**: 

- BIG-IP licenses and basic understanding of the BIG-IP system.
- Existing Kubernetes cluster and basic understanding of the Kubernetes platform.

**Sample Diagram**:

Configuration tips and caveats
------------------
- Ensure proper disaggregation in front of BIG-IP
- Ensure that AS3 Tenant/Partition names *do not* overlap
- Ensure that AS3 declaration specifies below:
    - trafficGroup property
        - number assignment method example: TG1=prod, TG2=staging
        - *details below*
    - shareNodes property
        - To allow Nodeport IPs to be configured in /Common so other partitions can use it
        - *details below*
- Only Nodeport or potentially Calico BGP could work
    - auto-sync and Flannel cannot be configured together
- Multi K8s Cluster with 1 CIS deployment per cluster
- BIG-IP in scalen A/A/S with auto config-sync (optional)
- Ensure no more than 3 CIS point to a single VE (max tested)
- Configure HA order to favor a standby before converging TGs on a single VE
- Consider multiple regions of cluster and use GSLB (DNS) for load balancing between regions
- For IPv6 addresses, use :code:`hostAliases` as CIS does not connect right now to an IPv6 address (|knownissue|)

**trafficGroup property**:
You can specify the traffic group associated with any virtual address so that all associated objects float with that traffic group in a ScaleN (N+1) configuration. See |clouddocs_tg|_ for more details. 

You can then reference the :code:`Service_Address` name for the :code:`virtualAddresses` property for your virtual server. 

.. note: The :code:`"use"` pointer references an AS3 object in the same declaration. On the other hand you can use the :code:`"bigip"` pointer for objects that already exist on BIG-IP. 

**shareNodes property**: 
You can configure :code:`shareNodes` so that multiple tenants can use the same node IP, which gets created in the /Common partition. See |clouddocs_sn|_ for more details. 

**serviceMain**:
If you use a template with a value of http, https, tcp, udp, or l4, you MUST specify an object with the matching Service class Service_HTTP, Service_HTTPS, Service_TCP, Service_UDP, or Service_L4 and name it serviceMain as described in the following Service Class section. See |clouddocs_sm|_ for more details.

.. note: When using the generic template, your virtual server name must not be “serviceMain”
